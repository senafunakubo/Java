One fundamental concept of object-oriented programming in Java is the class.
A class is a set of instructions that describe how a data structure should behave.
A class constructor will allow us to create Dog instances. With a class constructor,
we can set some information about the Dog.


Class: a blueprint for how a data structure should function
Constructor: instructs the class to set up the initial state of an object
Object: instance of a class that stores the state of a class
Method: set of instructions that can be called on an object
Parameter: values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method
Return value: specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs
Inheritance: allows one class to use functionality defined in another class
